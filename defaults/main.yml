# Role default lower priority variables

# List of dicts with volume groups to setup. The dicts have the same attributes
# that the ones expected by the ansible lvg module. For example:
#
# lvm_vg:
#   - vg: testing
#     pvs: /dev/sdb1
#     pesize: "4"
#     state: present

lvm_vg: []

# Dicitionary with the defaults options to use if no other ones are specified in
# the `lvm_vg` variable. The members of the dict are the same attributes
# that the ones expected by the ansible lvg module

lvm_vg_defaults:
  state: present

# Indicate `lvm_vg` must be loaded also from host variables. Any host variable
# that begins with "lvm_vg_*" and contains the necessary attributes
# will be loaded as an item to manage by the role. The variables must follow the
# structure detailed before for `lvm_vg`

lvm_vg_load_from_hostvars: no
